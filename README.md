# Week 2 Homework Project - Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

For our week two homework project assignment, we needed to take the same HTML & CSS portfolio website we made for week one and make it responsive compatible.  I did this by adding a link to the Bootstrap css stylsheet, hosted remotely on Bootstrap's servers.  From there, I just needed to add the needed classes to existing block items.  The end result was the old portfolio that didn't change appearance, in response to resizing my browser window, will now adjust its layout to fit different screen and media sizes.
